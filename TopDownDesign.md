Project includes at least one additional class not outlined in the spec contained in its own file with no executable code outside the class. The correct number of Board, Cell, and Ship objects are created. Very little code is not contained within a class.

4 x 4 game board
. = Empty space
S = Ship
  Cruiser = 3 cells
  Submarine = 2 cells
H = Hit
M = Miss
X = Sunken ship
Game Over = Both ships are sunk

B . . . .
C . . S .
D . . S .

```### Battleship Game
1. Build code for iteration 1
 1.1 Create a ship class ruby file
 1.2 Create a ship class test file
  1.2.1 Require minitest
  1.2.2 Require minitest pride
  1.2.3 Write a test to ensure that the object exists
   1.2.3.1 Assert the instance of the object
  1.2.4 Write a test to ensure that the object can return its attributes
   1.2.4.1 Assert that the attribute equals the object and the method
   1.2.4.2 Make sure that the test(s) pass
  1.2.5 Write a test for each method created
   1.2.5.1 Assert that each expected answer is equal to the method being called on the
   1.2.5.2 Make sure that the test(s) pass object

   1.3 Create a ship class ruby file
   1.4 Create a ship class test file
    1.4.1 Require minitest
    1.4.2 Require minitest pride
    1.4.3 Write a test to ensure that the object exists
     1.4.3.1 Assert the instance of the object
