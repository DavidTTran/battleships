# Project: Battleships

##### Group Member Names: David Tran & Kelsha Darby

#### Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
David:
- My goals for this project is primarily focused around the collaboration - getting used to working with others. Of course, the overall goal is a working program written collaboratively, with code/feedback/changes from both parties.

Kelsha:
- My goals for this project are also centered around working and learning as a team. I look forward to learning from one another, and learning how to work cohesively to create a working program. I hope to find a way to give/receive feedback and write code together while understanding our personality differences and working through that.

#### Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
David:
- Objective-Analytical - Responsible, intellectual, calm and avoids impulsive decisions
- Searcher - Self aware and sees benefits in discussing ones problems
- Calm Cool and Collected - Regulate impulses and able to separate feelings from logic
- Lover of Moderation - Regulate appetites and emotions. Respectful of boundaries and ready to give to others

Kelsha:
- Cooperative-Practical - I am sincere, supportive and optimistic. I work well doing detail oriented work and focusing on the issues at hand.
- Specialist - I plan my work out, work with precision and enjoy solving problems
- Calm, Cool & Collected - I think things through before speaking or acting on anything.
- Lover of Moderation - I value my well-being and remaining humble. I also value forgiveness and flexibility when things get tough.

#### How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
- Since we share similar pairin results, we're both open to listening to each others ideas/feedback and understanding that it's more practically based rather than emotionally. Should we come across an obstacle, we're able to break it down into smaller more manageable pieces.

#### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
David:
- I'm available at all times, and tend to stay after class for a few hours.

Kelsha:
- I am available most days and have been staying late any days I can. I have listed my scheduling constraints below.

*Constraints:*
Kelsha:
- Feb 5th and 6th - I am unavailable during lunch those days
- Feb 5th - I have to leave school by 4:45PM - 5:00PM
- Feb 6th - Feb 13th - I am house sitting for someone in Brighton so I may need to leave a little bit earlier (5:30PM or 6:00PM at the latest)
- Feb 8th - I am available anytime after 11:30AM

#### Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):
David:
- I'm not against checking in every-day, but at least a few times a week, depending on how we work/split up tasks.

Kelsha:
- I would like to check in anytime we begin work on something new just to see where the other person is at and to ensure that we are not doing the same work twice. I would also like to do weekly check ins to see how we are both feeling about the project.

#### Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
David:
- I like to think that I'm good at loops. I want to improve my ability to see how classes/instances/methods interact with each other, especially when in different files.

Kelsha:
- I think I am getting pretty good at creating and using methods. As well as writing tests and following iteration patterns. I hope to get better at using enumerables and refactoring my code.

#### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
David:
- I don't really have a preference, a little of each so we both get experience with writing methods and tests.

Kelsha:
- I don't mind what we each work on as long as the workload is fair and we both get to work and learn an equal amount.

#### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
David:
- Pull requests at logical points, review code/tests before merging.

Kelsha:
- I second that. Pull requests at good stopping points but only merging to master when the code is pristine and "client-ready". I would also like to work to debug issues with the code together so that we both get experience working through different types of errors and test failures.

#### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
David:
- Feedback shouldn't always be an agreement. Suggestions/questions/discussion are also equally as important.

Kelsha:
- I think we should give feedback as often as possible. The more communication the smoother the process will go. I think debating different ways to do things will also be very important in learning how to code with a pair or team.

#### Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
David:
- I don't really like jumping from page-to-page or to different applications. If we can write a TDD in the project repo and check stuff off as we go, it'd probably be ideal.

Kelsha:
- I think working through something like a top down design would be great. I think it would also be beneficial to talk through who will be doing what or if we will be tackling the coding in a driver-navigator style so that we are both on the same page with everything.

#### Day 1 Agenda:
- Write a top down design of creating the battleship game
- Decide how we will get started, especially if we are working remote for day 2

#### Additional Notes:
Kelsha:
- I am most reachable via slack and am open to Zoom calls

David: I tend to be on a computer a lot of the time regardless, so slack or even text messages would be the best way to contact me.
