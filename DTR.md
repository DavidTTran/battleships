# Project: Battleships

##### Group Member Names: David Tran

#### Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
- My goals for this project is primarily focused around the collaboration - getting used to working with others. Of course, the overall goal is a working program written collaboratively, with code/feedback/changes from both parties. - David

#### Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
David
- Objective-Analytical - Responsible, intellectual, calm and avoids implusive decisions
- Searcher - Self aware and sees benefits in discussing ones problems
- Calm Cool and Collected - Regulate impluses and able to separate feelings from logic
- Lover of Moderation - Regulate appetites and emotions. Respectful of boundaries and ready to give to others
#### How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

#### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
- I'm available at all times, and tend to stay after class for a few hours. - David

#### Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):
- I'm not against checking in every-day, but at least a few times a week, depending on how we work/split up tasks. - David

#### Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
- I like to think that I'm good at loops. I want to improve my ability to see how classes/instances/methods interact with each other, especially when in different files. - David

#### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
- I don't really have a preference, a little of each so we both get experience with writting methods and tests. - David

#### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
- Pull requests at logical points, review code/tests before merging. - David

#### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
- Feedback shouldn't always be in agreement. Suggestions/questions/discussion are also equally as important. - David

#### Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
- I don't really like jumping from page-to-page or to different applications. If we can write a TDD in the project repo and check stuff off as we go, it'd probably be ideal. - David
